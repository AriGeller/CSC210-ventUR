# CSC210-ventUR

+ventUR is a web application designed for University of Rochester students to help them plan events and meetups with friends.

Our vision with the app was to create an app that could organize events as small as impromptu lunches with friends to weeks-long vacations. For example, if you plan on going to a dining hall in half an hour, and want people to eat with, you can create a general event called "Lunch at Danforth", and make it open to all your friends to see an join. If you want to plan a more complicated event, such as a roadtrip, you can do that ahead of time, invite friends, and arrange transportation.
